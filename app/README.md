# README.md for `app`

## Overview

The `app` directory contains the implementation of a chat application built using Chainlit and FastAPI. This application is designed to facilitate real-time communication between users and a backend service, providing features such as message handling, response generation, and health monitoring.

## Structure

The `app` directory includes the following key files:

- **main.py**: This is the main entry point of the chat application. It implements the core functionality, including health check endpoints to monitor the service's status (live, ready, and startup). The application initializes chat settings, processes user messages (including images), and communicates with a FastAPI backend to generate responses. The code is well-structured and includes comprehensive comments for clarity.

- **app_logging/**: This subdirectory contains utilities for structured logging within the application. It ensures consistent logging practices across different modules, making it easier to track application behavior and diagnose issues.

- **__init__.py**: This file initializes the chat application and includes a message handler that processes user messages and generates responses. It also sets up an event handler that displays a welcome message when the application starts. The code is well-commented for easy understanding.

- **__pycache__/**: This directory contains compiled bytecode files generated by Python to improve performance. It is managed automatically by Python and should not be modified manually.

## Internal Dependencies

The application relies on several external libraries, which are managed in a virtual environment. Key dependencies include:

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Chainlit**: A library for creating interactive web applications.
- **Requests**: A simple HTTP library for making requests to the backend service.
- **Dotenv**: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your virtual environment before running the application.

## Usage

To get started with the chat application, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Start the chat application by executing the main script.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to the specified URL (usually `http://localhost:8000`) to interact with the chat application.

## Important Notes

- **Health Check Endpoints**: The application includes health check endpoints to monitor its status. You can access these endpoints to ensure the service is running correctly.
  
- **Logging Configuration**: The logging behavior can be customized using environment variables. Refer to the `app_logging` module for more details on how to configure logging.

## Conclusion

The `app` directory provides a comprehensive implementation of a chat application using Chainlit and FastAPI. With well-structured code and clear documentation, developers can easily understand and extend the application. For further questions or issues, please refer to the documentation of the respective libraries used in this project.
